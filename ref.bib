An important task of EBSNs is to facilitate the most satisfactory event-participant arrangement for both sides, i.e., events enroll more participants and participants are arranged with personally interesting events. Existing approaches usually focus on the arrangement of each single event to a set of potential users, or ignore the conﬂicts between different events, which leads to infeasible or redundant arrangements. In this paper, to address the shortcomings of existing approaches, we ﬁrst identify a more general and useful event-participant arrangement problem, called Global Event-participant Arrangement with Conﬂict and Capacity (GEACC) problem, focusing on the conﬂicts of different events and making event-participant arrangements in a global view. We ﬁnd that the GEACC problem is NP-hard due to the conﬂicts among events. Thus, we design two approximation algorithms with provable approximation ratios and an exact algorithm with pruning technique to address this problem. In addition, we propose an online setting of GEACC, called OnlineGEACC, which is also practical in real-world scenarios. We further design an online algorithm with provable performance guarantee. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and efﬁciency of the proposed methods through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets.},

	abstract = {Online event-based social networks (EBSNs) and studies on global event-participant arrangement strategies for EBSNs are becoming popular recently. Existing works measure satisfaction of an arrangement by a linear combination of few factors, weights of which are predeﬁned and ﬁxed, and do not allow users to provide feedbacks on whether accepting the arrangement or not. Besides, most of them only consider oﬄine scenarios, where full information of users is known in advance. However, on real-world EBSN platforms, users can dynamically log in the platform and register for events on a ﬁrst come, ﬁrst served basis. In other words, online scenarios of event-participant arrangement strategies should be considered. In this work, we study a new event-participant arrangement strategy for online scenarios, the FeedbackAware Social Event-participant Arrangement (FASEA) problem, where satisfaction scores of an arrangement are learned adaptively and users can choose to accept or reject the arranged events. Particularly, we model the problem as a contextual combinatorial bandit setting and use eﬃcient and eﬀective algorithms to solve the problem. The eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of the solutions are evaluated with extensive experimental studies and our ﬁndings indicate that the state-of-the-art Thompson Sampling that is reported to work well under basic multi-armed bandit does not perform well under FASEA.},

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

	abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

	abstract = {As a new way of training generative models, Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) that uses a discriminative model to guide the training of the generative model has enjoyed considerable success in generating real-valued data. However, it has limitations when the goal is for generating sequences of discrete tokens. A major reason lies in that the discrete outputs from the generative model make it difficult to pass the gradient update from the discriminative model to the generative model. Also, the discriminative model can only assess a complete sequence, while for a partially generated sequence, it is non-trivial to balance its current score and the future one once the entire sequence has been generated. In this paper, we propose a sequence generation framework, called SeqGAN, to solve the problems. Modeling the data generator as a stochastic policy in reinforcement learning (RL), SeqGAN bypasses the generator differentiation problem by directly performing gradient policy update. The RL reward signal comes from the GAN discriminator judged on a complete sequence, and is passed back to the intermediate state-action steps using Monte Carlo search. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world tasks demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines.},
